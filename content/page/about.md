My name is James William McNab and I am a web developer & designer. Originally from York, I studied at Sheffield Hallam University and graduated with a First-class Honours degree in Computer Networks.

I create unique and interesting websites, web applications and brand indentities primarily online but also through print and other mediums.

I have a strong interest in web standards and good coding practices, which I apply through my in-depth knowledge of HTML, CSS and PHP as well as jQuery and SQL.

I work for a company in the telecoms industry, developing web solutions and creating branding materials to support our cutting-edge mobile voice and data solutions.

As well as sitting in front of a computer, I do the odd bit of photography, occasional games of tennis and practising my juggling & bar flair technique s, as well as many other things.
